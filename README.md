# Hit Finder

Hit Finder is a useful website that allows for easily browsing the top songs on the Billboard Hot 100 and finding where to listen to them. It was created as a school project to practice the implementation of APIs (Billboard and musicAPI) and our experience with Materialize.
## Features

- Searching for music
- Displaying the top ten songs of the Billboard Hot 100, Global 200, ect.
- Linking songs to their streaming sources
- Not effecting your suggested songs
